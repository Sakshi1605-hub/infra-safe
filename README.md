# InfraSafe – AI Infrastructure Monitoring System

## 🚧 Problem Statement
Critical infrastructure such as bridges, roads, buildings, and public structures
are prone to damage due to overload, vibration, temperature changes, and strain.
Manual inspection is slow and reactive.

## 💡 Our Solution
InfraSafe is an AI-assisted infrastructure monitoring system that:
- Continuously monitors sensor data
- Detects abnormal behavior
- Explains what went wrong
- Shows what normal conditions should be
- Assesses risk level
- Suggests suitable solutions
- Keeps the final decision with humans

## ⚙️ Features
- Normal vs Abnormal condition detection
- Risk factor identification
- AI-generated solution + justification
- Human decision options: IGNORE / REJECT / ACCEPT
- Simple dashboard UI

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python (data analysis & logic)
- Pandas, NumPy
- CSV-based sensor dataset
- HTML & CSS (UI prototype)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## 📊 Sample Parameters Monitored
- Load
- Vibration
- Temperature
- Strain

## 🧪 Project Status
Hackathon Prototype (Offline Demo)

## 👩‍💻 Team
- Sakshi (Team Lead / Developer)

## 🏆 Hackathon Ready
This project is designed for offline hackathon demonstration with
clear explainability and human-in-the-loop decision making.
